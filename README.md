# Gross_PredictiveAnalysis_IMDB_Python
This is a course project for Data Analytics with Python using Machine Learning algorithms for prediction purpose.

With the rapid development of technology and big data, entertainment is quite a big part of people's daily life. Thus, more and more people and investors focus on movie industry in the context of promoting the development of movie industry. Exploring the influence factors of box office and trying to predict box office level could make a difference when it comes to promoting the development of movie industry and helping investors to make better decisions to gain high revenues.

As we all know, as time goes by,the key factors that affect the box office are increasing and their underlying relationships are ever-changing. All these challenges make it more valuable for us to try to analyze the trend of people's interests and the market and build models to predict revenues for future movies to help the people in the film industry.

### Objectives & Structure
The goal for our project is to utilize analysis to help people who are either investors or have interests in movies to make better decisions on selecting the movies to invest or get a glance at a movie’s future by predicting a movie’s revenue class. In order to achieve this goal, NLP, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are implemented. Word clouds, multiple plots and analysis reports are generated for data exploratory analysis.

Below are our project flowchart and description.
